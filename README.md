# Code challenge from digital skill(Simple documentation)

### Python implementation of test suites using selenium webdriver and pytest

# To run standalone
  Follow instaruction on https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/ to install your bindings.
  
```aiignore
  checkout the repository
  # change directory to base directory , digitalskill
  # install dependencies in your venv 
    ~/digitalskills$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
  # To run 
  ~/digitalskills$ pytest test_compare_car_quotes.py
  ..
```

### Structure of code:
 * ..[/digitalskills/Inpput_file_loc ](digitalskills/Inpput_file_loc): location where the given input file is stored
 *  ../digitalskills/Inpput_file_loc : location where the given output file is stored
 * [../digitalskills/utils](digitalskills/utils) : contains utility classes to do the heavy listing
     * [valuation_site_locator_repository.json](utils/valuation_site_locator_repository.json) : repository of css identifies for Vehicle valuation vendors website,
       Only single location to map all the signatures of selenium web drivers object locators. more on this later
     * [elements_locator.py ](utils/elements_locator.py): utility class for access to the web driver object locators based on the vendor keys
     * [extract_uk_reg_num.py](utils/extract_uk_reg_num.py) : Class encapsulating logics to extract the vehicle registration information from the given input and out put files
 * [conftest.py](conftest.py) : pytest conftest file containing fixtures required for the test
 * [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) compose file to use for docker run and CI/CD integration
 * [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml): docker file to build the image for the test framework
 * [pytest.ini](pytest.ini) : pytest configuration file, can be populated with additional config for test execution,
 * [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) : package requirement file for run environment, generated by pip freeze 
 * [test_compare_car_quotes.py](utils/test_compare_car_quotes.py) Sample test case implemented for a vendor, [motorway.co.uk]

 Test workflow:
 
The test framework is designed with the following in mind:
 1. Centralised object identification repository, this contains all the selenium web drivers selectors per vehicle valuation vendor required to build the test that simulates the specified workflow
 2. To add a new vendor, simple introspect the vendors workflow and update the required selector in the repository, if the signatures changes (which is bound to happen), then we have only one location to change 
 3. Uses page object model that abstracts each vendor workflow, allowing addition, removal, update and easy test orchestration strategy., Test logic is encapsulated in class providing all routines for the particular vendor
 4. More input and output files can be added to discover move Reg number, Test seaches through directory/relative path/full path to discover input and output file
 5. docker-compose file for CI/CD integration (this is a review and throw away project , so did not implement certain elements for CI/CD integration, Healthcheck, Health Status, E.T.C)
